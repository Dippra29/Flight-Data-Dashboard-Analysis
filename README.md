## Flight Data Dashboard and Visualization Project
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of flight-related data using Excel. The project focuses on data modeling, interactive dashboards, and advanced visualizations.
Key elements include pivot tables, measures, and a connected data model to derive insights into flight performance, ticketing, and passenger trends.

### Key Features:
1. Data Modeling: 
   - Multiple interconnected datasets (Airports, Flights, Tickets, etc.).  
   - Relationships defined to analyze passenger bookings, flight routes, and seat occupancy.

2. Pivot Tables:  
   - Dynamic pivot tables summarize complex flight data.  
   - Explore metrics like total passengers, revenue per flight, and seat utilization.

3. Interactive Dashboard: 
   - Visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs).  
   - Features charts for passenger trends, ticket sales, and flight comparisons.

4. Measures: 
   - Custom measures (such as total revenue, average fare) enhance data analysis capabilities.  
   - Designed for aggregating and slicing data across various dimensions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
- Excel (Pivot Tables, Data Model, Dashboard)  
- Data Analysis Functions and Visualizations  

This project showcases advanced Excel capabilities for data analytics and visualization.
